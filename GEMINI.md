# spec-superflow

Use the bundled agent skills in `skills/` to run the spec-superflow workflow.

Start from `workflow-start` when a user wants to start, continue, resume, plan, implement, review, debug, close, or inspect a spec-superflow change.

The workflow is self-contained and does not require OpenSpec or Superpowers at runtime. It uses OpenSpec-style planning artifacts and Superpowers-style execution discipline through the `execution-contract.md` handoff.
